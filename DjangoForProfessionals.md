## Summary

### Chapter 1: Initial Set Up

__Terminal:__ The program that allows access to the command line through opening a new window.

__Console:__ Text-based application.  

__Shell:__ The program that uses the underlying operating system to run commands.

-Instructions on how to install Git.  

-Django is used to build modern, robust web applications with a minimal amount of code by a large number of developers.

### Chapter 2: Hello World, Docker

-Things like different computers, operating systems, versions of Django, virtual environment options make it difficult to properly configure a local development environment.  

-Docker makes it possible to faithfully and dependably reproduce a production environment locally which enables easy collaboration within development teams.  

-Docker implements virtualization by isolating an entire operating system via Linux containers.  

__Virtual Machines:__  Complete copies of a computer system from the operating system on up.

-Virtual machines have the disadvantage of requiring additional computing resources to run multiple guest operating systems on a single piece of hardware.

-Docker provides an efficient solution with virtualization from the Linux layer with container.

-The venv module that comes with the Python 3 standard library allows the creation of virtual environments to manage Python packages for different projects.

-Docker containers have the advantage of isolating non-Python software as well
