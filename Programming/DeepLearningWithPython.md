## Summary

### Part 1: Fundamentals of deep learning

### Chapter 1: What is deep learning?

#### 1.1 Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning

##### 1.1.1 Artificial Intelligence 

the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans

AI is a general field that encompasses machine learning and
deep learning, but that also includes many more approaches that don’t involve any
learning like hard coding

 Although symbolic AI proved suitable to solve well-defined, logical problems, such as
playing chess, it turned out to be intractable to figure out explicit rules for solving more
complex, fuzzy problems, such as image classification, speech recognition, and language translation

#### 1.1.2 Machine learning

In classical programming, the paradigm of symbolic AI, humans input rules (a program) and data to
be processed according to these rules, and out come answers

With machine learning, humans input data as well as the answers expected from the data,
and out come the rules. These rules can then be applied to new data to produce original answers.

A machine-learning system is trained rather than explicitly programmed.
