## Description

Machine Learning Resource Book

## Summary

### Chapter 1: Preface

-This book focuses on high-level fundamentals, including key terms, general workflow, and the statistical underpinnings of basic algorithms.

### Chapter 2: What is Machine Learning?

__Machine Learning:__ A subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  

__Self Learning:__ The application of statistical modeling to detect patterns and improve performance based on data and empirical information.  

-Machine learning is based on input data to function rather than input commands.

__Hyperparameters:__ The parameters that are explicitly defined to control the learning process.  

-Exposure to input data thereby deepens the model's understanding of patterns, including the signicant changes in the data, and to construct an effective self-learning model.  

__Training Data:__ The initial reserve of data used to train the machine learning model.  

__Test Data:__ The reserve of data used to evaluate the algorithm or training model.  

-Computer Science > Data Science > AI > Machine Learning

-Whereas data mining focuses on analyzing input variables to predict a new output, machine learning extends to analyzing both input and output variables.
