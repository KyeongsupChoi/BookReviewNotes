## Description

Machine Learning Resource Book

## Summary

### Chapter 1: Preface

-This book focuses on high-level fundamentals, including key terms, general workflow, and the statistical underpinnings of basic algorithms.

### Chapter 2: What is Machine Learning?

__Machine Learning:__ A subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  

__Self Learning:__ The application of statistical modeling to detect patterns and improve performance based on data and empirical information.  

-Machine learning is based on input data to function rather than input commands.

__Hyperparameters:__ The parameters that are explicitly defined to control the learning process.  

-Exposure to input data thereby deepens the model's understanding of patterns, including the signicant changes in the data, and to construct an effective self-learning model.  

__Training Data:__ The initial reserve of data used to train the machine learning model.  

__Test Data:__ The reserve of data used to evaluate the algorithm or training model.  

-Computer Science > Data Science > AI > Machine Learning

-Whereas data mining focuses on analyzing input variables to predict a new output, machine learning extends to analyzing both input and output variables.  

-In unsupervised learning only the input is known and in reinforcement learning only the output is known.

### Chapter 3: Machine Learning Categories

-Supervised learning requires known input(labeled dataset) and includes regression analysis(i.e. linear regression, logisitc regression, non-linear regression) decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, neural networks and support vector machines.  

-Unsupervised learning instead focuses on analyzing relationships between input variables and uncovering hidden patterns that can be extracted to create new labels regarding possible outputs. 

-Unsupervised learning is hard to validate and can be subjective.  

-Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include social network analysis and descending dimension algorithms.  

-Semi-supervised learning hybridizes labeled and unlabeled cases with the goal of leveraging unlabeled cases to improve the reliability of the prediction model.  

-Reinforcement learning builds its prediction model by gaining feedback from random trial and error and leveraging insight from previous iterations.  

-A specific example of a reinforcement learning algorithm is Q-learning. 

### Chapter 4: The Machine Learning Toolbox

-Data constitutes the input needed to train the model and generate predictions.  

-In a tabular dataset the columns would be a feature/variable/dimension/attribute and the rows would be a case/value.  

-Machine learning infrastructure consists of platforms and tools for processing data. 

-The central tools are the machine learning algorithms.  

-Data visualization is used to communicate results to relevant decision-makers.  

-Advanced machine learning uses, big data techniques, cloud infrastructure, and advanced algorithms.  

### Chapter 5: Data Scrubbing  

-Data scrubbing is the technical process of refining the dataset to make it more workable.
