## Summary

### Section 001: 운영체제의 개념

> __운영체제/OS; Operating System:__ System software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
> 
> __처리 능력/Throughput:__ The amount of something (such as material, data, etc.) that passes through something (such as a machine or system)
>
> __반환시간/Turn Around Time:__ The amount of time taken to complete a process or fulfill a request.
>
> __사용가능도/Availability:__ The ability of a user to access information or resources in a specified location and in the correct format.
>
> __운영체제/Reliability:__ The expectation that the computer and any related functions like networking performs consistently per specifications.
>
> __운영체제/Processor:__ The electrical component (digital circuit) that performs operations on an external data source.
>
> -Windows, UNIX, Linux, MacOS, MS-DOS, Android, iOS are some of the most well-known and used Operating Systems.

### Section 002: Windows

> __그래픽 사용자 인턴페이스/GUI:__ A form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation.
> 
> __선장형 멀티 태스킹/Preemptive Multi-Tasking:__ A type of multitasking that allows computer programs to share operating systems (OS) and underlying hardware resources. It divides the overall operating and computing time between processes, and the switching of resources between different processes occurs through predefined criteria.
>
> __32비트|64비트/32bit|64bit:__ Machine code with 32-bit or 64-bit virtual memory addresses.
>
> __FAT32 파일 시스템/File Allocation Table System:__ Deprecated file system.
>
> __Plug N play:__ A specification that facilitates the recognition of a hardware component in a system without the need for physical device configuration or user intervention in resolving resource conflicts.
> 
> __OLE|Object Linking and Embedding:__ Technology developed by Microsoft that allows embedding and linking to documents and other objects.
>
> __DOS와 호환:__ A computer operating system that resides on and can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc.

### Section 003: UNIX/LINUX

> __UNIX:__ A family of multitasking, multiuser, time-sharing computer operating systems written in C that derive from the original AT&T Unix open source.
>
> [__UNIX Architecture__] - Hardware > Kernel > Shell > Utility > User
>
> __커널/Kernel:__ A computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system. It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components
>
> __쉘/Shell:__ A command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
>
> __유틸리티/Utility:__ 
> 
> __LINUX:__ A family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel.
