## Description

- If we want to find the way back to ourselves and one another, we need language and the grounded confidence to both tell our stories 
- and to be stewards of the stories that we hear. 
- In Atlas of the Heart, we explore eighty-seven of the emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human 
- and walk through a new framework for cultivating meaningful connection. This is for the mapmakers and travelers in all of us.

## Summary

### Introduction

### #1: Places We Go When Things Are Uncertain or Too Much 

Stressed
We feel stressed when we evaluate environmental demand as beyond
our ability to cope successfully. This includes elements of
unpredictability, uncontrollability, and feeling overloaded.

Overwhelmed 
means an extreme level of stress, an emotional
and/or cognitive intensity to the point of feeling unable to function. 

anxiety as “an
emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and
physical changes like increased blood pressure.” 

Worry is described as a chain of negative
thoughts about bad things that might happen in the future.

Avoidance, the second coping strategy for anxiety, is not showing up
and often spending a lot of energy zigzagging around and away from
that thing that already feels like it’s consuming us.

excitement is described as an energized state of enthusiasm
leading up to or during an enjoyable activity, 

Dread occurs frequently in response to high-probability negative
events; its magnitude increases as the dreaded event draws nearer.

Fear is a negative, short-lasting, high-alert emotion in
response to a perceived threat, and, like anxiety, it can be measured as
a state or trait. 

Vulnerability is the emotion that we experience during times of
uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.

Vulnerability is not weakness; it’s our greatest measure of courage.

### #2: PLaces We Go When We Compare:

Comparison is the crush of conformity from one side and competition
from the other—it’s trying to simultaneously fit in and stand out.

Comparison says, “Be like everyone else, but better.”

We feel admiration when someone’s abilities, accomplishments, or
character inspires us, or when we see something else that inspires us,
like art or nature.

Reverence, which is sometimes called adoration, worship, or
veneration, is a deeper form of admiration or respect and is often
combined with a sense of meaningful connection with something
greater than ourselves.

Envy occurs when we want something that another person has

Jealousy is when we fear losing a relationship or a valued part of a
relationship that we already have

Resentment is the feeling of frustration, judgment, anger, “better
than,” and/or hidden envy related to perceived unfairness or
injustice. It’s an emotion that we often experience when we fail
to set boundaries or ask for what we need, or when expectations
let us down because they were based on things we can’t control,
like what other people think, what they feel, or how they’re
going to react.

In the case of “schadenfreude,” it simply means
pleasure or joy derived from someone else’s suffering or misfortune.

freudenfreude, which
is the opposite of schadenfreude—it’s the enjoyment of another’s
success. It’s also a subset of empathy.

Shoy: intentionally sharing the joy of someone relating a
success story by showing interest and asking follow-up
questions.

Bragitude: intentionally tying words of gratitude toward the
listener following discussion of personal successes
