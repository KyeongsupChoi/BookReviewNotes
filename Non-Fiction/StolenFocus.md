## Description

Book investigating the shrinking attention span of people and the root cause.

## Summary

### Introduction: Walking in Memphis

- The author takes his teenage nephew to Memphis and notices a disturbing trend of people glues to their phones. 

- He decides to take a sabbatical to Provincetown and be without a smartphone or internet access as a digital cleanse of sorts.

### Cause One: The Increase in Speed, Switching, and Filtering

- A professor noticed how a topic would trend on Twitter for increasingly shorter amounts of time.

- A similar churn occurred in Wikipedia, Reddit, and Google.  

- An increase in reading speed results in a decrease of reading comprehension. 

- Human minds are incapable of multitasking but rather speed switching.

### Cause Two: The Crippling of Our Flow States

- The flow state of total concentration on a single task is central to our well-being.  

- Flow states require a task of optimal difficulty and is easily broken.  

### Cause Three: The Rise of Physical and Mental Exhaustion

- Mental and Physical exhaustion negatively affect focus.  

- A lack of sleep has become normalized.  

### Cause Four: The Collapse of Sustained Reading

- The amount of sustained reading and focusing for long periods has gone down dramatically.  

- The method of information delivery is just as important as the content.  

- Reading novels has numerous benefits.  

### Cause Five: The Disruption of Mind-Wandering

- Allowing your mind to wander and daydream is an important activity for the brain.  

- This mind-wandering allows for new connections and creative thinking.  

### Cause Six: The Rise of Technology That Can Track And Manipulate You (Part One)

- Big Tech companies are motivated to drive up engagement or distraction as it profits them.  

- One of the worst offenders is the design of infinite scroll.  

### Cause Six: The Rise of Technology That Can Track And Manipulate You (Part Two)

- Big Tech companies make money through advertising and showing more and more personalized ads.

- Showing content that angers and provokes a reaction promotes engagement.  

- The algorithms used also turns people against each other on a social scale.  

### The First Glimpses of the Deeper Solution

- Legislating Big Tech companies would be a start.  

- The business model could be changed to improve people's lives rather than monetize peoples' attention.  

- History has shown that positive societal change on this scale is possible.  

### Cause Seven: The Rise of Cruel Optimism(or: Why Individual Changes are an Important Start, But Not Enough)

- Cruel optimism is taking a larger societal problem and offering a simplistic individual solution.  

### The Places that Figured Out How to Reverse the Surge in Speed and Exhaustion

- People self-reported the biggest causes of worsening attention as stress, change in life circumstances, or disturbed sleep.  

- Addressing environmental, economic and root causes had a significant effect in helping attention deficits.

### Cause Eight: The Surge in Stress and How it is Triggering Vigilance

### Cause Nine and Ten: Our Deteriorating Diets and Rising Pollution 

### Cause Eleven: The Rise of ADHD and How We Are Responding to it

### Cause Twelve: The Confinement of Out Children, Both Physically and Psychologically

## Thoughts and Opinions

-Very important book and need to apply lessons.

-Need to use phone less.
